### Introduction data set

We have selected the [CRASH-2](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/DataSets/crash2.html) data set provided by Vanderbilt School of Biostatistics for our project. It describes the outcome of a randomized controlled trial and economic valuation of the effects of tranexamic acid on death, vascular occlusive events and transfusion requirement in bleeding trauma patients. Tranexamic acid reduces bleeding in trauma patients undergoing surgery, but is an expensive treatnment option. The trial's objective was to assess the effects and cost effectiveness of an early administration of this medication. 

Participants of the study were adults with, or at risk of, significant bleeding within 8 hours of injury. Sample randomization was determined by the allocation of an eight digit sequence randomly generated by a computer. Patients and staff were masked to treatment allocation of the tranexamic acid.

We have adjusted the original data set to remove a number of variables that were not relevant to our investigation. We have removed variables regarding the exact surgerical procedures administered to patients, various IDs, and details on the patient outcome. We removed the health outcome columns because of complications regarding missing data, where the boolean structure of the columns relating to specific outcomes, like stroke or pulmonary embolism, left a large number of cases with missing values. Instead, we added a boolean variable for a general outcome of survival to assess the efficacy of the procedure, rather than looking at particular health outcomes in post-surgery for living patients. 

We will be using variables regarding the sex, age, and injury of the patient as well as certain bio metrics, like blood pressure, respiratory and heart rates, details on surgical blood transfusion, and a boolean variable on the survival of the patient. Our selection provides us with a balance of continuous and categorical variables, many of which are boolean, with minimal complications due to missing data.

#### Discussion on the individual variable distributions

age

Age appears to be largely weighed to the left, with lower ages featuring more frequently than those that are greater, possibly reflecting that younger people often take more risk and work higher at risk occupations, raising their chance of experiencing trauma involving bleeding.

sex

Sex is heavily weighed to males, similar to age, possibly demonstrating that men take more risk and work at higher risk occupations. increasing the likelihood of experiencing trauma that would involve large amounts of bleeding.

injurytime

Injury time is weighted to the right, with almost all values falling below ten minutes since the injury was experienced. This is likely due to the fact that in cases of serious injury victims are brought to the hospital quite quickly.

injurytype

Shows that the majority of patients have a blunt trauma, at 5211, then 2937 have a penetrating injury and 1349 with both.

sbp

It seems that Sbp (Systolic Blood Pressure) is a fairly centrally balanced distribution around 90 mmHg. This is logical as a sample of biological charatersitics observed in a population are likely to have most people around the mean and then a reasonably tight distribution of those who differ, similar to that of other biological charatersitics like height. Futhermore, most people are fairly young in the sample and therefore would have rates that deviant less from the norm, at a healthy level.

rr

rr (Respiratory Rate) appears, similar to sbp, resembling a moderatly balanced distribution around 22 respirations per minutes, although is weighted more to the right.

hr 

hr (Heart rate) also seems fairly balanced at around 110, similar to the variables above. like rr and sbp.

cc

HISTOGRAM MISSING

ndaysicu

The distribution is heavily weighted to the left and right skewed. Most patients it seems, with injuries at high risk of bleeding, do not often need to remain in hospital for long.

ncell

The distribution is weighted to the left a median of 3, with many patients, only needing small number of or zero units of red cell products transfused.

nplasma

Similar to ncell, with, in fact, a meadian at 0, the distribution is weighed to the left and therefore many patients only need a small number of or zero units of plasma transfused. The kernal density is at zero and very tightly distributed on zero.

nplatelets

Even more extreme than nplasama, the kernal density distribution is centred at 0 with only a number of values above zero for nplatelets. Clearly most patients do not need platelets transfused. 

ncryo

A very similar kernal density distribution to nplatelets, centred around 0 with only a few patients requiring cryoprecipitate transfused.

bvii

The value for bvii is 9456 for 0 and 41 for 1, showing that the vast majority of patients do not receive recombinant factor VIIa.

death

Shows that most patients survive the trail with 7672 surviving in comparison to 1825 who did not.

### Graphical visulations of quantitative variable relationships

Scatterplot Matrix of quantitative variables

```{r echo=FALSE}
pairs(~age+injurytime+sbp+rr+cc+hr, data=X,
      main="Quantitative Scatterplot Matrix Set 1", col=color_1)
pairs(~age+ndaysicu+ncell+nplasma+nplatelets+ncryo, data=X,
      main="Quantitative Scatterplot Matrix Set 2", col=color_1)
```
Scatterplot Matrix of quantitative variables by sex

```{r echo=FALSE}
colors_sex <- c(color_2,color_3)[1*(X$sex=="Male")+1]
pairs(~age+injurytime+sbp+rr+cc+hr, data=X,
      main="Quantitative Scatterplot Matrix Set 1 by Gender", col=colors_sex))
pairs(~age+ndaysicu+ncell+nplasma+nplatelets+ncryo, data=X,
      main="Quantitative Scatterplot Matrix Set 2 by Gender", col=colors_sex)
```      

We seperated our quantitative variables into two sets of scatterplot matrices as we have too many variables to do one set. It is hard to see any definite relationships between variables for any set of variables. We can see that some variables, as we discussed above, are very unbalanced and therefore the observations are concentrated in specific regions of the scatter plot like for the plots of ncryo, nplatelets and more. Other distributions, almost appear as "shotgun" distributions with no distinct grouping such as those for age in relation to sbp, rr, cc, and hr as well as for hr and other variables, for example. These relationships are sensible for more balanced distributions as they are not weighted or skewed in a certain area of the plot. We do not see any remarkable difference in terms of sex.

Andrews plot

```{r echo=FALSE}
X_quan <- X[,c(3,4,6,7,8,9,10,12,13,14,15)]
X_quan
library("andrews")
andrews(as.data.frame(cbind(X_quan,as.factor(X[,1]))),
        clr=8,
        ymax=4,
        main="Andrews' Plot in terms of Sex")
```

The Andrew's plot agrees with our observation above. We do see a difference in the distributions of sex in the Andrews' plot, but not very substantially.
